## Description

<p>My attempt at making a real-time chat application using mongo, express, React-native, node.js, and socket.io
</p>

<p>A full-stack social media app with a variety of features: Full CRUD functionality (you can create, search, filter, edit, and delete user accounts, messages, public chatrooms, private chatrooms, and DMs). The app is composed of 5 main screens: Sign-up, Sign-in, Users, Channels, and the Room screen (where text and images can be sent over a low-latency websocket connection). Users can upload an image to use as a custom avatar for their user account or any channel they create, as well as send/receive friend requests, receive push-notifications, mark specific channels as "mature", and set an expiration on messages and/or channels so that they will delete themselves after a chosen amount of time!
</p>

<p>
Additionally, while the user is on the "Channels" screen, they can filter channels by old/new, or the number of messages currently contained


</p>
Each channel also shows a badge indicating how many users are actively inside that room at any given time


<p>
When the user is on the "Room" screen, they can see who is also active in that room, view user profiles, upload image and text messages, invite/kick members (if room is private), and block or report inappropriate content.

</p>
I originally started making this app as a learning experiment, because I had just started learning React-Native, and wanted to try making my own full-stack, publicly-available app. It eventually grew and expanded much further than I originally anticipated, so I had to spend a lot of time researching and organizing everything.


<p>
I created this app using a combination of React-Native, Expo, socket.io, node.js, Express, and MongoDB.


</p>

<p>
I eventually used Expo to create the ios and android builds which I then submitted to the app stores, where I get occasional downloads and messages from random folks every now and then
